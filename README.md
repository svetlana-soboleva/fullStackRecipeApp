# 📝 Recipe App

Welcome to the Recipe App! This is a project developed with the goal of creating a platform for sharing and discovering high-quality recipes. As a pastry chef, I understand the challenges of finding reliable and professional recipes. This app aims to bridge that gap and provide a platform where everyone can access and cook like a pro.

The Recipe App has been successfully deployed! You can now visit the following link to explore and enjoy the recipes: [(https://recipeapp.cru48dbdvmnvs.eu-north-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/)] 

# 🎯 Motivation

I wanted to create a space where people, whether professional chefs or home cooks, could access a diverse range of reliable and well-crafted recipes. By sharing my knowledge and passion for cooking, I hope to make the culinary experience enjoyable and accessible to everyone.
